----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_prj_gameplay/u_top_game/u_player_control_y/currentjump_nxt_reg[3]_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_prj_gameplay/u_top_game/u_player_control_y/currentjump_nxt_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell u_top_prj_gameplay/u_top_game/u_player_control_y/currentjump_nxt_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
